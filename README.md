#### Use of Markdown:

> Markdown is preferred over WYSIWYG editors because it is versatile, portable, platform-independent, future-proof, and widely supported. It can be used for various purposes like websites, documents, and emails, and its plain-text format ensures compatibility across different applications without locking users into proprietary file formats. Markdown works on any operating system and remains readable even if specific applications become obsolete, making it ideal for long-term document preservation. Additionally, its widespread adoption on platforms like Reddit and GitHub enhances its usability across different environments.
